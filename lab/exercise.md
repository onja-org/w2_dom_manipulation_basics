- Think about how you can **“create something new in the DOM”** before adding it anywhere.  
- There’s a way to **mark an element differently** without changing the HTML manually.  
- Removing things is easier if you **know who the parent is**.  
- You can make elements appear or disappear by **toggling something invisible**.  
- Don’t forget: inputs have a property that **holds what the user typed**.
