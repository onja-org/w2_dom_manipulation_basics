# üìù Advanced DOM Manipulation Exercise

## Goal

Build a fully interactive Dynamic Task List App using advanced DOM manipulation techniques in JavaScript.

## Instructions

### Create a task list app with the following functionality:

- Add tasks dynamically

- Enter a task in the input and add it to the list.

- Each task should be created using a template and appended to the list efficiently.

### Mark tasks as completed

- Clicking a task toggles its completion status.

### Delete tasks

- Each task should have a delete button that removes it from the list.

- Clear completed tasks

- Remove all tasks marked as completed with a single action.

### Optional enhancements

- Store extra task info (e.g., ID or timestamp).

- Add animations or dynamic styling for added/removed/completed tasks.

### Requirements

- Use template cloning to create new tasks.

- Use event delegation for click events on tasks.

- Use data attributes to store task metadata.

- Update the DOM efficiently (e.g., consider using DocumentFragment).

### Challenge

Your goal is to build a smooth, dynamic experience where the list updates instantly, new tasks are added efficiently, and completed tasks are managed dynamically ‚Äî all without refreshing the page.
