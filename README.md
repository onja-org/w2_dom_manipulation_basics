# 🌳 DOM Manipulation Basics

Welcome to the **DOM Manipulation Basics** lab!  
This lab will help you understand how JavaScript makes web pages **interactive and dynamic**.

By the end of this module, you’ll know how to access, modify, and create elements directly from JavaScript.

## 📚 What You’ll Learn

- **Understand the DOM** – how your webpage is represented as a tree of elements and how JavaScript interacts with it.  
- **Select and manipulate elements** – access elements and change their content, attributes, or styles.  
- **Update content dynamically** – use `.textContent`, `.innerText`, and `.innerHTML`.  
- **Handle user events** – respond to clicks, input, and other interactions.  
- **Create and remove elements** – add new tasks or delete existing ones on the fly.  
- **Change styles and attributes** – update classes, colors, or images dynamically.

## 💡 Try These in the Demo

- Add new tasks and see them appear in the list.  
- Click tasks to mark them as completed or uncompleted.  
- Delete tasks using the delete buttons.  
- Change the logo dynamically with the “Change Logo” button.  
- Use the “Change Background Color” button to update the app’s appearance.  
- **Experiment with the Reading & Updating Content demo:**  
  - Click **Change `textContent`** and see all text replaced.  
  - Click **Change `innerText`** and see visible text replaced.  
  - Click **Change `innerHTML`** and see text replaced **with formatting** (like bold).  
  - Try **to make element visible means removing the hidden style** inside the paragraph to see how `.innerHTML` updates the content visually.  

All of these actions help you **understand how to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and dynamically update content and styles**.
