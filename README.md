# ðŸŒŸ Advanced DOM Manipulation Lab

Welcome to the Advanced DOM Manipulation Lab!
In this lab, youâ€™ll learn how to efficiently interact with, modify, and optimize the DOM using JavaScript.
Advanced DOM manipulation is key to building fast, interactive web pages that respond instantly to user actions without reloading.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Dynamically add, remove, and update elements on the page

- Use template cloning for reusable UI components

- Handle user interactions efficiently with event delegation

- Store and manage element metadata with data-* attributes

- Optimize DOM updates using DocumentFragment and batching techniques
